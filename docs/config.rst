.. _config:

Configuration file
==================

Scrapyd searches for configuration files in the following locations, and parses
them in order with the latest one taking more priority:

* ``/etc/scrapyd/scrapyd.conf`` (Unix)
* ``c:\scrapyd\scrapyd.conf`` (Windows)
* ``/etc/scrapyd/conf.d/*`` (in alphabetical order, Unix)
* ``scrapyd.conf``
* ``~/.scrapyd.conf`` (users home directory)

The configuration file supports the following options (see default values in
the :ref:`example <config-example>`).

http_port
---------

The TCP port where the HTTP JSON API will listen. Defaults to ``6800``.

bind_address
------------

The IP address where the HTTP JSON API will listen. Defaults to ``0.0.0.0`` (all)

.. _max_proc:

max_proc
--------

The maximum number of concurrent Scrapy process that will be started. If unset
or ``0`` it will use the number of cpus available in the system multiplied by
the value in ``max_proc_per_cpu`` option. Defaults to ``0``.

.. _max_proc_per_cpu:

max_proc_per_cpu
----------------

The maximum number of concurrent Scrapy process that will be started per cpu.
Defaults to ``4``.

max_jobs_per_project
----------------

The maximum number of concurrent Scrapy process per project.
Defaults to ``4``.

debug
-----

Whether debug mode is enabled. Defaults to ``off``. When debug mode is enabled
the full Python traceback will be returned (as plain text responses) when there
is an error processing a JSON API call.

eggs_dir
--------

The directory where the project eggs will be stored.

dbs_dir
-------

The directory where the project databases will be stored (this includes the
spider queues).

logs_dir
--------

The directory where the Scrapy logs will be stored. If you want to disable
storing logs set this option empty, like this::

    logs_dir =

logs_filename
-------------

The filename (appended to ``logs_dir``) to use for the crawl. ``{project}``
and ``{spider}`` placeholders will be substituted, as will certain datetime
elements (but only ``{Y}``, ``{m}``, ``{d}``, ``{H}``, ``{M}``, ``{S}``).

For example,

   logs_filename = {spider}-{Y}{m}{d}.log

If no value is specified, the default value is ``{project}/{spider}/ID.log``
(where ``ID`` is the job id).

Note: if a custom value for ``logs_filename`` is used then ``jobs_to_keep`` is
no longer applicable. Scrapyd will not delete old log files.

.. _items_dir:

items_dir
---------

.. versionadded:: 0.15

The directory where the Scrapy items will be stored.
This option is disabled by default
because you are expected to use a database or a feed exporter.
Setting it to non-empty results in storing scraped item feeds
to the specified directory by overriding the scrapy setting ``FEED_URI``.

.. _jobs_to_keep:

jobs_to_keep
------------

.. versionadded:: 0.15

The number of finished jobs to keep per spider.
Defaults to ``5``.
This refers to logs and items.

This setting was named ``logs_to_keep`` in previous versions.

.. _finished_to_keep:

finished_to_keep
----------------

.. versionadded:: 0.14

The number of finished processes to keep in the launcher.
Defaults to ``100``.
This only reflects on the website /jobs endpoint and relevant json webservices.

poll_interval
-------------

The interval used to poll queues, in seconds. Defaults to ``5``.

runner
------

The module that will be used for launching sub-processes. You can customize the
Scrapy processes launched from Scrapyd by using your own module.

application
-----------

A function that returns the (Twisted) Application object to use. This can be
used if you want to extend Scrapyd by adding and removing your own components
and services.

For more info see `Twisted Application Framework`_

.. _webroot:

webroot
-------

A twisted web resource that represents the interface to scrapyd.
Scrapyd includes an interface with a website to provide simple monitoring
and access to the application's webresources.
This setting must provide the root class of the twisted web resource.

node_name
---------

.. versionadded:: 1.1

The node name for each node to something like the display hostname. Defaults to ``${socket.gethostname()}``.

.. _config-example:

Example configuration file
--------------------------

Here is an example configuration file with all the defaults:

.. literalinclude:: ../scrapyd/default_scrapyd.conf
