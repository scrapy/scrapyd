Scrapyd Configuration file
==========================

Scrapyd searches for configuration files in the following locations, and parses
them in order with the latest ones taking more priority:

* ``/etc/scrapyd/scrapyd.conf`` (Unix)
* ``c:\scrapyd\scrapyd.conf`` (Windows)
* ``/etc/scrapyd/conf.d/*`` (in alphabetical order, Unix)
* ``scrapyd.conf``

The configuration file supports the following options (see default values in
the :ref:`example <topics-scrapyd-config-example>`).

http_port
---------

The TCP port where the HTTP JSON API will listen. Defaults to ``6800``.

bind_address
------------

The IP address where the HTTP JSON API will listen. Defaults to ``0.0.0.0`` (all)

.. _max_proc:

max_proc
--------

The maximum number of concurrent Scrapy process that will be started. If unset
or ``0`` it will use the number of cpus available in the system mulitplied by
the value in ``max_proc_per_cpu`` option. Defaults to ``0``.

.. _max_proc_per_cpu:


max_proc_per_cpu
----------------

The maximum number of concurrent Scrapy process that will be started per cpu.
Defaults to ``4``.

debug
-----

Whether debug mode is enabled. Defaults to ``off``. When debug mode is enabled
the full Python traceback will be returned (as plain text responses) when there
is an error processing a JSON API call.

eggs_dir
--------

The directory where the project eggs will be stored.

dbs_dir
-------

The directory where the project databases will be stored (this includes the
spider queues).

logs_dir
--------

The directory where the Scrapy logs will be stored. If you want to disable
storing logs set this option empty, like this::

    logs_dir =

.. _items_dir:

items_dir
---------

.. versionadded:: 0.15

The directory where the Scrapy items will be stored. If you want to disable
storing feeds of scraped items (perhaps, because you use a database or other
storage) set this option empty, like this::

    items_dir =

.. _htdocs_dir:

htdocs_dir
----------

.. versionadded:: 0.18

The directory where a custom Scrapy Web interface is stored::

    items_dir =

.. _jobs_to_keep:

jobs_to_keep
------------

.. versionadded:: 0.15

The number of finished jobs to keep per spider. Defaults to ``5``. This
includes logs and items.

This setting was named ``logs_to_keep`` in previous versions.

runner
------

The module that will be used for launching sub-processes. You can customize the
Scrapy processes launched from Scrapyd by using your own module.

application
-----------

A function that returns the (Twisted) Application object to use. This can be
used if you want to extend Scrapyd by adding and removing your own components
and services.
